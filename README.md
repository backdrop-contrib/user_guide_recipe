## Details

This module enables the book module and add some sample content to help you get started with a user guide for your site. This is a way to create some admin only content to help your site managers, site editors and future developers understand how to use the site.

Specifically, here is a list of the changes that this module makes to your site:

- Enables the Book module (in core) and creates the User Manual book. The User Manual has general information about Backdrop, but can also be customized and used a site specific user manual for this specific site. 
- Installs and enables the Content View Access module. The Content View Access module is a contrib module that allows us to easily set access permissions for specific content types. We are using this module to make Book pages only accessible to authenticated users.
