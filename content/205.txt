<p>Layouts divide pages on your site into different columns or regions where content can be placed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Backdrop's primary tool for positioning content is through&nbsp;<em>Layouts</em>. The&nbsp;<em>Layout</em>&nbsp;module allows you to assign specific "templates" to your site or to specific pages on your site. A "layout template" is the template that defines regions in which pieces of content may be placed. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Layout&nbsp;</strong>- a configuration in which a particular layout template has been assigned to a website path. The Default layout applies the default template to all paths without a specified layout.</li>
	<li><strong>Layout template</strong>&nbsp;- a page design created with HTML markup and PHP variables that define&nbsp;regions in which pieces of content may be placed</li>
	<li><strong>Stand-alone layout&nbsp;</strong>- a stand-alone layout will only ever affect a single page on the site.&nbsp;The layout itself generates this page. A good example of a stand-alone layout is the default Home page.</li>
	<li><strong>Dynamic layout</strong>&nbsp;- a dynamic layout is a layout that can affect multiple pages. In this case, the pages that are affected are always generated by other&nbsp;sources.&nbsp;This type of&nbsp;layout will require the "Existing page content" block.</li>
</ul>
