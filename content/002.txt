<p>As a site administor, there are our top three tips to help you get started.&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Be sure to <strong>checkout the Dashboard</strong> in the admin menu. It's a good place to find many of the things that you will need to access most often.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Take some time to <strong>familiarize yourself with the layout system in Backdrop</strong>. It's a powerful tool, but takes a little time to get used to.&nbsp;</li>
